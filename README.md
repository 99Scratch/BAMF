Botnet Attack Modular Framework

BAMF is a modular framework designed to be a platform to launch attacks against botnets.  This framework is more than your usual exploit framework, as botnets have many moving parts and not all attacks are looking to execute code.
This framework will focus on many different things, initially with getting the health of the botnet, information from the botnet, then simple (non-proxied) attacks against the botnet.

Note: Until I have more time to actually design a v1, I will mostly be uploading different PoCs to this repository into the IntegrationQueue folder.  The purpose of the IntegrationQueue is ideas to incorporate into the design.
